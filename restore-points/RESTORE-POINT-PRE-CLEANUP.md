**Commit**: a81e589
**Branch**: main
**Status**: ✅ STABLE - All features working, ready for cleanup

---

## 📸 Snapshot Summary

This restore point captures the state **immediately before** performing Option B thorough cleanup for distribution build.

### What's Working:

- ✅ All 4 OAuth platforms (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter)
- ✅ Content generation (memes, videos, bulk generation)
- ✅ Content library with selection system
- ✅ Post scheduling with timezone support
- ✅ Dark mode support
- ✅ Content selection/deselection with visual preview
- ✅ Security: credentials protected, no sensitive data in git

### Audit Results:

- ✅ Security: PERFECT
- ⚠️ Code Quality: 2 issues to fix (obsolete function, backup file)
- ⚠️ Optional: 3 cleanup items (ESLint configs, random image)

---

## 🎯 What Happens Next

**Planned Changes (Option B Cleanup)**:

1. Delete obsolete `renderLibrary()` function (line 2110, ~100 lines)
2. Delete `renderer.js.bak` backup file
3. Clean up duplicate ESLint configs (keep `eslint.config.js`, remove `.eslintrc.js` and `.eslintrc.json`)
4. Move/delete `fullwebpic.jpg` from root
5. Run `npm run lint` to verify no issues

**Risk Level**: 🟢 LOW

- Only removing dead code and unused files
- No functional code changes
- Verified renderLibrary() has ZERO calls
