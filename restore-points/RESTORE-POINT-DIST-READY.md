**Date:** October 18, 2025
**Tag:** `v1.3-dist-ready`
**Branch:** `feature/video-functionality`
**Status:** ✅ Ready for Beta Distribution (Unsigned)

## Summary

App is fully functional and ready for distribution. Dark mode toggle now refreshes library cards immediately. All features working, ready to build and share with testers. Unsigned build chosen to avoid code signing costs - perfectly safe for beta testing.

---

## What's Working ✅

### Core Features

- ✅ **AI Image Generation** - OpenAI DALL-E integration
- ✅ **Meme Generation** - memegen.link API
- ✅ **Video Generation** - FFmpeg with 3 modes (meme-to-video, AI text-to-video, bulk)
- ✅ **Hashtag Generation** - AI-powered hashtags
- ✅ **Content Library** - Grid view with filters (All/Meme/Video/Posted/Draft)

### Library Card Actions

- ✅ **Reuse Button (Blue)** - Load content back to form for editing
- ✅ **Schedule Button (Green)** - Schedule posts with 8-step validation
- ✅ **Delete Button (Red)** - Remove from library
- ✅ All buttons side-by-side with bold, colorful styling

### Dark Mode ⭐ NEW FIX

- ✅ **Instant Toggle Refresh** - Library cards update immediately when toggling dark mode
- ✅ No more waiting until new content saved
- ✅ Complete theme switching across all UI elements

### Scheduling System

- ✅ Background scheduler (60-second polling)
- ✅ 8-step validation before scheduling:
  1. Content exists
  2. Schedule time provided
  3. Schedule time is in future
  4. At least one platform selected
  5. Social media tokens configured
  6. AI provider keys available
  7. Warning dialog for missing credentials
  8. User can proceed or cancel

### Security & Data

- ✅ AES encryption for sensitive fields
- ✅ IPC context isolation (secure preload bridge)
- ✅ JSON validation on all file writes
- ✅ Token storage encrypted at rest
- ✅ `.env` file not tracked in git

### UI/UX

- ✅ Responsive 3-column grid layout
- ✅ Window size constraints (min 800x600)
- ✅ Glass morphism design
- ✅ Z-index stacking fixed
- ✅ Video playback in library (Windows file:// URLs)

## Technical Changes

### renderer.js

**Dark Mode Toggle Fix:**

```javascript
// Changed from sync to async function
async function handleDarkModeToggle(ev) {
  const on = ev.target.checked;
  document.documentElement.classList.toggle("dark", on);
  document.body.classList.toggle("dark", on);

  const container = document.querySelector(".container");
  if (container) container.classList.toggle("dark", on);

  // NEW: Refresh library cards immediately
  await displayLibraryContent();

  addLogEntry(`Dark mode ${on ? "enabled" : "disabled"}`);
}
```

**Why This Fixes It:**

- Before: Library cards rendered once, kept old styles when toggling
- After: Cards re-render on toggle, picking up new dark mode CSS
- Result: Instant visual feedback when switching themes

---

## Distribution Strategy

### Unsigned Build (Chosen Approach) ✅

**Why Unsigned:**

- 💰 **FREE** - No code signing certificate cost ($99-400/year)
- ⚡ **FAST** - Build immediately, no setup needed
- 🧪 **PERFECT FOR BETA** - Trusted testers don't need signing
- 🔒 **EQUALLY SECURE** - App security unchanged, signing is just identity proof
- 💪 **DIY FRIENDLY** - Complete control, no dependencies

**Build Command:**

```bash
npm run dist:unsigned
```

**Output:**

```
dist/
  win-unpacked/        ← Distribute this folder
    ai-auto-bot.exe    ← Main executable
    resources/         ← Your code + Electron
    node_modules/      ← Dependencies
```

**Windows SmartScreen Warning:**

- Users will see: "Windows protected your PC - Unknown publisher"
- Action: Click "More info" → "Run anyway"
- Why: No code signing certificate (intentional)
- Safe: App is secure, warning is just for identity verification

## Known Limitations

### Expected Behavior

1. **Windows SmartScreen Warning**
   - Not a bug, expected for unsigned builds
   - Users click "More info" → "Run anyway"
   - Can remove with code signing certificate ($99-400/year)

2. **OAuth Not Pre-Configured**
   - Users must add their own social media tokens
   - Schedule validation warns if tokens missing
   - App works without social media (local generation/library)

3. **API Keys Required for AI Features**
   - Need OpenAI key for AI image/video generation
   - Memes work without any keys
   - Keys stored encrypted locally

### No Known Bugs

- All features working as designed
- No crashes or errors
- Performance within targets
- Security properly implemented
