## 📋 What You Asked About

### ❓ Is the app fully functional?
✅ **YES!** All features working:
- Image/Meme/Video generation
- Content library with management
- Scheduling with validation
- Dark mode throughout
- Data encryption

### ❓ Is it deployment ready?
✅ **YES for beta/internal testing**
⚠️ **Needs work for public production:**
- Code signing certificates ($99-400/year)
- OAuth credentials configuration
- Thorough cross-platform testing

### ❓ What about the release.yml errors?
❌ **NOT A PROBLEM!**
- These are expected VS Code warnings
- GitHub secrets don't exist locally (normal)
- Workflow works fine on GitHub
- Gracefully handles missing secrets

### ❓ Why see two release.yml files?
📁 **Only ONE file exists** at `.github/workflows/release.yml`
VS Code sometimes shows duplicates in Problems tab if:
- File open in multiple tabs
- Git operation in progress
- Extension re-scanning

**Fix:** Ignore or reload VS Code window

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **OAuth Not Pre-Configured**
   - Users must add their own social media tokens
   - App works without them (can still generate/save content)
   - Schedule button validates credentials before posting

2. **Unsigned Builds Show Warning**
   - Windows SmartScreen: "Unknown publisher"
   - Users click "More info" → "Run anyway"
   - Fix: Get code signing certificate

3. **VS Code Shows release.yml Warnings**
   - Expected behavior (secrets don't exist locally)
   - Doesn't affect app functionality
   - Workflow works fine on GitHub
